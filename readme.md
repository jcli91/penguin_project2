# Project 2
#### By Jeffery Li

## Project Summary

I will create an app that will allow users to create an account to post pictures
and details about their pet. The main page after users log-in will show all the pictures of said pet. If a user decides to click a picture, it will direct them to a more detailed view of the pet. Some details would include a name, an age, breed/species, and what they like to do in their time.
